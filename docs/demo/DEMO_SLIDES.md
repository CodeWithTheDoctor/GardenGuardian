# GardenGuardian AI - Demo Presentation Slides

## **Slide 1: Hook**

```
🌱 GardenGuardian AI
"The Plant Health Platform Australia Needs"

[Image: Before/after plant recovery]
Problem: $500-2000 lost annually per Australian household
```

## **Slide 2: Market Validation**

```
📊 Market Opportunity
• 4.2M Australian households garden (40% of population)
• $4.5B annual home gardening market
• 30-40% produce loss due to late disease detection
• No existing platform combines AI + Australian compliance
```

## **Slide 3: Technical Honesty**

```
🏗️ Current Implementation Status

✅ PRODUCTION READY:
• Next.js 15 + TypeScript frontend
• Mobile-first PWA with camera integration
• Professional UI/UX (shadcn/ui components)
• Complete user journey design

⚠️ PROTOTYPE PHASE:
• Backend: Simulated Firebase for demonstration
• AI: Mock responses for user testing
• Authentication: UI components only
```

## **Slide 4: Architecture Competence**

```
🔧 Production Technical Stack

Frontend (✅ Built):
├── Next.js 15 (App Router)
├── TypeScript (strict mode)
├── Tailwind + shadcn/ui
└── PWA + Camera API

Backend (📋 Planned):
├── Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Storage)
├── Google Vision + Custom TensorFlow
├── APVMA compliance APIs
└── Australian supplier integrations
```

## **Slide 5: Database Schema**

```typescript
🗄️ Data Architecture Design

interface Diagnosis {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  aiAnalysis: {
    confidence: number;
    disease: string;
    severity: 'mild' | 'moderate' | 'severe';
    metadata: { modelVersion, processingTime }
  };
  treatments: Treatment[];
  userFeedback?: FeedbackData;
}
```

## **Slide 6: AI Pipeline**

```python
🤖 Plant Disease Recognition Pipeline

def analyze_plant_image(image_url: str):
    # 1. Image preprocessing & quality validation
    # 2. Google Vision API + Custom TensorFlow model
    # 3. Australian disease filtering
    # 4. Confidence scoring & uncertainty quantification
    # 5. Treatment recommendation engine
    return DiagnosisResult(disease, confidence, treatments)

Training: 50k+ Australian plant disease images
Target: >90% accuracy on test set
```

## **Slide 7: Australian Compliance**

```typescript
🇦🇺 Regulatory Compliance Engine

async function validateAustralianCompliance(
  treatment: Treatment,
  userState: string
): Promise<ComplianceStatus> {
  const apvmaResult = await apvmaService.validateTreatment();
  const stateRestrictions = await checkStateRestrictions();
  
  return {
    compliant: boolean,
    apvmaNumber: string,
    restrictions: Restriction[]
  };
}
```

## **Slide 8: Implementation Roadmap**

```
🚀 Development Timeline

Phase 1 (4-6 weeks): Core MVP
├── Firebase authentication
├── Google Vision integration  
├── Australian treatment database
└── APVMA compliance checking

Phase 2 (6-8 weeks): AI Enhancement
├── Custom plant disease model
├── Confidence scoring
└── Treatment effectiveness tracking

Total: 20-28 weeks | Budget: $150k-250k
```

## **Slide 9: Competitive Advantage**

```
🏆 Why We'll Win

Regulatory Moat:
• Only platform with deep APVMA integration
• Australian-specific disease recognition
• Local supplier partnerships (Bunnings, etc.)

Technical Excellence:
• Mobile-first for real garden conditions
• Community-driven expert validation
• Weather-based predictive alerts

Market Timing:
• Post-COVID food security focus
• AI/health tech judge preference
• Australian-specific solutions advantage
```

## **Slide 10: Demo Transition**

```
