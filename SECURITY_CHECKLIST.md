# üîê Security Checklist - API Key Exposure Fix

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: API Keys Were Exposed

**Exposed Keys Found:**

- SendGrid API Key: `[REDACTED - Key has been removed from codebase]`

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Regenerate Compromised API Keys (URGENT)

- [ ] **SendGrid**: Go to SendGrid Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API Keys ‚Üí Delete the exposed key
- [ ] **Create new SendGrid API key** with appropriate permissions
- [ ] **Gemini API**: Check Google Cloud Console for any exposed keys and regenerate if needed
- [ ] **Firebase**: Check Firebase Console for any exposed keys and regenerate if needed

### 2. Update Environment Variables

- [ ] Edit `.env.local` file with your new API keys
- [ ] Test that all services work with new keys
- [ ] Never commit `.env.local` to git

### 3. Clean Git History

- [ ] Run: `./cleanup-git-history.sh`
- [ ] Force push cleaned history: `git push --force-with-lease origin main`
- [ ] Notify any collaborators to re-clone the repository

### 4. Repository Security

- [ ] Consider making repository private temporarily
- [ ] Check if any forks exist and contact owners
- [ ] Review all commits for other potential exposures

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION MEASURES

### Environment Variables Setup

```bash
# Run the template script (creates .env.local with placeholders)
./setup-env-template.sh

# Edit the created .env.local file with your actual keys
nano .env.local
```

### Git History Cleanup

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x cleanup-git-history.sh

# Run cleanup (WARNING: Rewrites history)
./cleanup-git-history.sh

# Force push cleaned history
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Security Best Practices

- [ ] Never commit API keys to git
- [ ] Use `.env.local` for local development
- [ ] Use environment variables in production
- [ ] Regularly audit git history for secrets
- [ ] Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` to scan for secrets

## üîç VERIFICATION STEPS

### Check for Remaining Exposures

```bash
# Search for potential API keys in current files
grep -r "AIza[A-Za-z0-9_-]{35}" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -r "SG\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{22}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -r "sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{48}" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
```

### Test Environment Variables

```bash
# Check if environment variables are loaded
npm run dev
# Visit /config page to verify all services are configured
```
